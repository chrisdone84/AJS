          🦸‍♂️ We are 'Super Proud' of our finishers of the Lakeside Ultra Challenge covering 100klm against the clock❤️
          They both ensured that they finished the challenge, with good times both placing well in the top 20% 🏆 of
          those competing (although we hear Ross did have to drag Dan along the last 20km) 😂😂😂 - but that's what
          TeamWork is all about eh!!! We have managed to raise an amazing £1,620.00 that will support multiple young
          ladies who require support from the incredible Little Lady Locks charity. Little lady locks provides custom
          made wigs to young females who have lost their hair due to alopecia and illnesses. ... and HUGE thank you to
          all those that supported us, with our biggest donation coming from Reactive Scaffold 🫶 amongst many more
          including Brian SMITHWICK, Tony Loughran, Emtech Group Limited, Tony Dawber - Thank you everyone 🚀 🔥
