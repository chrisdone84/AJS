          🚚 Our current fleet consists of 13 vehicles, from 18t scaffold wagons, to a new 7.5t, and two newly added
          2024 3.5t flatbacks, designed to increase operational flexibility and efficiency (just awaiting livery) 🚛 As
          part of our commitment to reducing environmental impact, all our vehicles are equipped with Euro 6 engines,
          meeting the highest emissions standards currently available and we are further exploring the electric vehicle
          options available 🌱 In addition, we’ve integrated real-time CO2 monitoring through Fast Fuel, allowing us to
          track and reduce our carbon footprint across our entire logistics operation. This data-driven approach ensures
          we are continuously minimizing emissions, enhancing both operational efficiency and environmental performance.
          Further supporting this initiative, we’re rolling out driver efficiency training this week. This program is
          designed to improve fuel economy, reduce wear and tear on vehicles, and further align with our commitment to
          sustainable growth as we continue to expand across the North West.{' '}
